            <li>Place the cooker in a sunny spot with no shade.</li>
            <li>
              Aline the cooker with the sun. Look at the shadow. Adjust
              alignment by rotating the cooker every hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare the meal by cooking at around 9-10 am so that it is ready
              for lunch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare the meal by cooking at around 1-2 pm so that it is ready
              for the evening meal. After 3 pm, solar cooking does not work
              properly.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the middle of the day when the sun is highest.</li>
            <li>
              Do not open cooker more than necessary. The cooker loses heat and
              longer time is needed.
            </li>
            <li>Cook without water, or with just a little.</li>
            <li>Do not dilute with cold water during the cooking.</li>
          </ol>

            Important to remember
          </text>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Most inexpensive solar cookers are quite slow, therefore it is
              important to plan ahead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always be prepared to change the method of cooking if the weather
              changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you put a pot with water in the cooker to warm up before
              preparing your ingredients, you save time by using this water in
              your casserole or soup.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you need to leave your cooker, turn it to where the sun will be
              later. In this way you can have your meal ready when you come
              back.
            </li>
            <li>
              By using your cooker you will learn from experience and adjust
              your methods to the time of the year and the weather.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              When setting up a solar cooker, ensure you stand in front of the
              cooker so that your shadow is cast on the cooker to reduce glare
              on your eyes.
            </li>
            <li>Use oven gloves when handling the hot pot.</li>
